# Password Generator using Tkinter

## Overview
This is a GUI-based password generator built with Python's Tkinter library. It enables users to create secure, random passwords with customizable options for length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters). Generated passwords can be easily copied to the clipboard for convenient use.

## Features
- **Customizable Passwords**: Set password length and choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and/or special characters.
- **Secure Generation**: Utilizes Python's `random` module for random character selection.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy generated passwords directly to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures minimum length and at least one character type are selected, with error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Features a light yellow theme, readonly password display, and clear button layout for ease of use.
